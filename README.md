# Motion in an Effective Potential – Student Activity

## 🎯 Educational Objective
Visualize how angular momentum creates a centrifugal barrier that confines the radial motion of a particle.

## 🧩 Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## 🧠 Instructions
1. Run:
   ```bash
   python potencial_efectivo.py


Modify parameters:

- Total energy
- Angular momentum
- Initial conditions

Observe how rmin, rmax, and the trajectory change in response.

💡 Tip: Try adjusting one parameter at a time to better understand its effect on the system.

🔍 4. Questions to Explore

- What happens if you increase the angular momentum?

- How does the confined region change with different energies?

- When do you obtain circular vs elliptical orbits?
